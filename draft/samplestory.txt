In the hospital, Bailey told me that I had to tell who did that to me, or the man would hurt another little girl.
    When I explained that I couldn’t tell because the man would kill him, Bailey said knowingly, “He can’t kill me. I
    won’t let him.” And of course I believed him. Bailey didn’t lie to me. So I told him.
    Bailey cried at the side of my bed until I started to cry too. Almost fifteen years passed before I saw my brother
    cry again.
    Using the old brain he was born with (those were his words later on that day) he gave his information to Grandmother
    Baxter, and Mr. Freeman was arrested and was spared the awful wrath of my pistol-whipping uncles.
    I would have liked to stay in the hospital the rest of my life. Mother brought flowers and candy. Grandmother came
    with fruit and my uncles clumped around and around my bed, snorting like wild horses. When they were able to sneak
    Bailey in, he read to me for hours.
