Mothers boyfriend, Mr. Freeman, lived with us, or we lived with him. (I never quite knew which.) 
He was a Southerner, too, and big. But a little fat. 
Even if Mother hadn’t been such a pretty woman, light-skinned with straight hair, he was lucky to get her,
and he knew it. She was educated, from a well-known family, and after all, wasn’t she born in St. Louis? 
She laughed all the time and made jokes. He was grateful. I think he must have been many years older 
than she, but if not, he still had the inferiority of old men married to younger women.
